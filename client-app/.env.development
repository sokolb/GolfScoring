# Vite Environment Variables for Development
# 
# IMPORTANT: After changing these values, restart the Vite dev server for changes to take effect

# Backend API URL
# The base URL for the Flask backend API
# Default: http://localhost:8082 (development server)
# Production: Set this to your deployed backend URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8082

# GHIN API Credentials (Optional)
# These credentials are used to automatically fetch and update player handicaps from the GHIN system
# 
# How it works:
# - When enabled, player handicaps are automatically updated from GHIN when:
#   1. A player with autoUpdateGHIN=true is loaded on the Matches page
#   2. A player is added/updated with autoUpdateGHIN=true on the Players page
#   3. "Refresh All Handicaps" button is clicked on the Players page
#
# What happens if NOT configured:
# - The app will still work normally for all other features
# - You'll see a 400 error in the browser console on pages that attempt GHIN login (e.g., Matches page)
# - Players with autoUpdateGHIN=true won't get automatic handicap updates
# - You can still manually enter handicap values for players
#
# To enable:
# 1. Get your GHIN credentials (username/email and password)
# 2. Uncomment and fill in the values below
# 3. Restart the dev server
#
# Example:
# VITE_USERNAME=your.email@example.com
# VITE_PASSWORD=your_password

VITE_USERNAME=
VITE_PASSWORD=
